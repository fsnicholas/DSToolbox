Coursera The Data Scientist's Toolbox (2017)

This course is an introduction to the tools and ideas that will be used in this course Data Science Specialization. 
The course track is focused on providing three things: 
(1) an introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight
(2) an introduction to the tools that will allow one to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and 
(3) giving plenty of hands on practice to learn the techniques oneself.

This course focuses primarily on getting set up with the appropriate tools and accounts needed for the rest of the specialization and on giving a solid grounding in the key conceptual ideas.
